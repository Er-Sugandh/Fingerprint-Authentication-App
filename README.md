# Fingerprint-Authentication-App
Fingerprint authentication uses the touch sensor built into many Android devices to identify the user and provide access to both the device and application functionality such as in-app payment options. The implementation of fingerprint authentication is a multistep process which can, at first, seem overwhelming. When broken down into individual steps, however, the process becomes much less complex. In basic terms, fingerprint authentication is primarily a matter of encryption involving a key, a cipher to perform the encryption and a fingerprint manager to handle the authentication process.  This chapter provides both an overview of fingerprint authentication and a detailed, step by step tutorial that demonstrates a practical approach to implementation.
